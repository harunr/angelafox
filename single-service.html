                                          <p>Emotionally Focussed Therapy helps individuals who want to understand how they connect with others and how best to deal with their needs for support from others.</p>

                                          <p>A secure attachment can be described as a long lasting psychological connection with a meaningful person that causes pleasure while interacting and which is soothing in times of stress. The quality of attachment to the significant people in our lives (our parents and significant others we grew up with) has a critical effect on our emotional development, and has been linked to various aspects of our emotional functioning, such as psychological well-being, physical health and quality of relationships.</p>
                                          <p>Four attachment styles have been identified: Secure, anxious- preoccupied, avoidant and disorganized. These attachment styles form in childhood and affect the quality of our relationships in life, be it our parenting relationship with our children, our relationships with</p> 
                                          <p>our partners, our friendship choices and our relationship with ourselves (our internal working models).  These internal working models can be seen as our beliefs and expectations that are formed in childhood and which become the template for our relationships. Research has demonstrated that these childhood relationships shape our perceptions of others and our understanding of their minds and motives.  These internal working models also influence the ways others are likely to treat us and perceive us. They impact our ability to manage and tolerate our emotions and the level of distress we experience. Our critical inner voice is one way to identify our conditioned belief systems. Once we have identified our critical inner voice, we can begin to challenge our beliefs and ideas. It will then be easier to change our behavior and shift the patterns that have kept us stuck in the past, and free ourselves to make more aware choices and to live more fully in the present.
                                              Attachment styles are passed down through the generations as we learn how to be in relationship through our experience and learning from those closest to us. These attachment styles can be healthy or unhealthy. If your relationships tend to be conflictual, toxic or unsatisfying, you probably have an insecure attachment style. Through therapy, you will become more aware of your unhealthy unconscious beliefs and patterns. As a result, you will be able to reflect on yourself and see how your past wounds and the defences that you create to protect yourself from being hurt again, become the walls that prevent you from having the closeness you need in relationships. You can then learn new way of being in relationship and will make more secure, healthy relationship choices.
